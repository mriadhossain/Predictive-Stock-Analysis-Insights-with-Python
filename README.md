## Methodology
- **Data Fetching**: Using `yfinance` to fetch historical adjusted close prices for each stock.
- **Data Analysis**: Using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applying Linear Regression to project future stock prices.

## Results
The analysis includes stock prices with moving averages, total return bar charts, correlation heatmaps, annualized volatility bar charts, and linear regression predictions.

## Discussion & Conclusion
The project demonstrates robust growth in the tech sector, with NVIDIA showcasing stellar performance. The predictive analysis provides estimations about future prices, emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring and analysis.
